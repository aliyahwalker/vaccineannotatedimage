      <p>In Connecticut <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/vaccine-portal/COVID-19-Vaccination-Phases">eligible residents </a>can get the COVID-19 vaccine at drive-up <a href="https://www.chc1.com/covid-19-vaccine/">vaccination clinics.</a> At these
        clinics, patients are able to get vaccinated without
        leaving the comfort of their cars. Licensed medical professionals, including nurses
        from the surrounding area and combat medics in the states National Guard, come to your car window once you reach their station to give you the vaccine.</p>

      <p>Vernon Walker, a Norwalk, Connecticut resident, recently was vaccinated at a drive up vaccination clinic. “It was great, I didn’t have to leave my car and there were enough national guard members around that I felt like if I had a problem or
        needed help, I’d be able to get it.”</p>

      <p> Vaccination clinics are run by <a href="https://www.chc1.com/">The Community Health Center, Inc (CHC).</a> The CHC is <a href="https://www.chc1.com/who-we-are/">"the leading nonprofit healthcare provider in the state of Connecticut".</a>
        These clinics are successful due to the multiple
        checkpoints (shown below) that ensure
        the efficiency of the clinic. Through the help of volunteers and the states National Guard members, some clinics are able to vaccinate up to 240 people a day.</p>

      <p> At these checkpoints, Connecticut’s National Guard members confirm your appointment date and time, direct you to the proper vaccination line, go through safety questions, and monitor your symptoms after your vaccine. These checkpoints
        progress the performance of these clinics. </p>

      <p>Walker stated that the checkpoints moved quickly, “The first few checkpoints were very quick you only stopped for a moment.” “The vaccination line and the observation area took the longest, but the wait wasn’t longer than 15 minutes.”</p>

                  this
                  checkpoint they also put a red or blue block on top of your car. This block lets the fellow members known which shot you are recieving, and if its your first or second dose.</p>
